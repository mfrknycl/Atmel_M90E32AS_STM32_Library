# Atmel M90E32AS STM32 Library

The [M90E32AS](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/Atmel-46003-SE-M90E32AS-Datasheet.pdf)  is a poly-phase high performance wide-dynamic range metering IC. The M90E32AS application note can be found [here](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/Atmel-46103-SE-M90E32AS-ApplicationNote.pdf).

The M90E32AS was controlled by STM32F030K6Tx using SPI communication protocol. No need to change the code for STM32F0xx.




## Getting Started

**To include this library, add** `#include "ENERGY_METER.h"` **at the begging of the code.**

**To include the HAL Library, add** `#include "stm32f0xx_hal.h"` **at the begging of the code.**
